# Neural Galaxy Launch – Social + Video Kit

Use this doc as a draft when announcing the latest Neural Galaxy build. The
copy is tailored for LinkedIn, Twitter/X, and YouTube, followed by a quick
demo-recording plan.

## LinkedIn Post (long-form)

> 🚀 **Neural Galaxy is live on GitHub Pages**  
> I spent the last sprint turning my 2025 AI chats into an explorable 3D
> universe—hand gestures, minimap, setup wizard, and one-click screenshots
> included.  
>   
> Why this matters:  
> - Data stays *entirely* in your browser. Import ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini
>   exports privately and watch the galaxy reshape itself in real time.  
> - The hosted demo ships with a 488-point sample galaxy so anyone can fly
>   through it instantly.  
> - Gesture mode + HUDs = a demo-ready wow factor for workshops and talks.
>   
> Getting started is literally `npm run dev`. Or just visit the live demo,
> press **I** for the Setup Guide, and drop your own JSON.  
>   
> Shout-out to the inspirations that sparked this direction:
> [soarxiv.org](https://soarxiv.org/), [Jarvis-CV](https://github.com/Suryansh777777/Jarvis-CV),
> and [@Sarthak](https://x.com/Sarthakhuh) for the “Neural Visualizer”
> concept.  
>   
> Repo & demo: https://github.com/ktwu01/neural-galaxy  
>  
> Would love feedback—especially from folks exploring spatial interfaces for
> personal knowledge management. 🌌

## Twitter / X Thread

1. **Tweet 1**  
   “Just shipped *Neural Galaxy* 🚀 – a browser-only 3D map of your AI chats.  
   Swipe through clusters, toggle gesture control, or press `S` for a
   screenshot. Demo + repo ↓”

2. **Tweet 2**  
   “✨ Highlights:  
   • client-side imports (privacy-first)  
   • setup wizard for ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini exports  
   • gesture HUD + minimap + floating actions”

3. **Tweet 3**  
   “Live demo (488 sample prompts) on GitHub Pages:
   https://ktwu01.github.io/neural-galaxy  
   Clone + `npm run dev` when you want to plug in your own data.”

4. **Tweet 4**  
   “Inspired by @Suryansh777777’s Jarvis CV, @SarthakHuh’s Neural Visualizer,
   and the OG soarxiv vibes. Feedback welcome! 🌠”

## YouTube Description (for a short demo clip)

> Neural Galaxy turns months of AI conversations into a gesture-controlled
> galaxy. Import your chat exports directly inside the browser (no backend,
> no data leaves your laptop) and explore clusters with a GTA-style minimap.
>  
> 🔹 Live demo & repo: https://github.com/ktwu01/neural-galaxy  
> 🔹 Setup Guide shortcut: press `I` in the app  
> 🔹 Screenshot shortcut: press `S` (3-second countdown)
>  
> Credits: soarxiv, Jarvis-CV, and the Neural Visualizer concept by
> @SarthakHuh for the inspiration.

## Demo Video Recording Script (High-Energy)

**Setup tips:**  
- Record at 60 FPS, hide desktop clutter, and keep the webcam on so viewers
  see your hands when you demo gestures.  
- Use the hosted demo for reliability; switch to local build only if you
  need custom data shots.

1. **Hook (8 s)**  
   “Hey friends, I’m Koutian—and this is what happens when you pour your AI
   brain dump into a galaxy.”

2. **Single-Both-Hands Gestures (15 s)**  
   Show your hands on camera. “Watch this: two-hand pinch to zoom out and
   open the whole cosmos… pull the hands in to dive straight into a cluster.”
   
   Single hand: 
   “Now I switch to one hand—Grab sends me forward, flash a Victory sign to
   fly backward, and watch the minimap redraw in real time while the focus
   HUD chases my fingertips.”

3. **Show the Detector Feed (12 s)**  
   Pop open devtools with `F12`. “See this panel? It’s streaming the hand
   tracking logits live, so you can literally watch the MediaPipe detections
   frame-by-frame—still all in-browser, nothing leaves my laptop.”

4. **Setup Guide Magic (15 s)**  
   Hit `I`. “Importing my own chats is literally press-I-and-drag-a-file.
   This wizard walks you through ChatGPT exports.”

5. **Screenshot Countdown (10 s)**  
   Smash `S`. “Need a shareable pic? Screenshot button drops a 3-second
   countdown, captures *everything*—panels, socials, copyright.”

6. settings (3s)

7. **Call-to-Action (8 s)**  
   “Link in the description: live demo + GitHub instructions. Clone it,
   swap in your data, and send me your galaxy selfie.”

Total runtime: ~70 seconds, punchy and catch-worthy.

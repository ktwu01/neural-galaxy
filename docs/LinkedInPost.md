# Neural Galaxy Launch – Social + Video Kit

Use this doc as a draft when announcing the latest Neural Galaxy build. The
copy is tailored for LinkedIn, Twitter/X, and YouTube, followed by a quick
demo-recording plan.

## LinkedIn Post (long-form)

> 🚀 **Neural Galaxy is live on GitHub Pages**  
> I spent the last sprint turning my 2025 AI chats into an explorable 3D
> universe—hand gestures, minimap, setup wizard, and one-click screenshots
> included.  
>   
> Why this matters:  
> - Data stays *entirely* in your browser. Import ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini
>   exports privately and watch the galaxy reshape itself in real time.  
> - The hosted demo ships with a 488-point sample galaxy so anyone can fly
>   through it instantly.  
> - Gesture mode + HUDs = a demo-ready wow factor for workshops and talks.
>   
> Getting started is literally `npm run dev`. Or just visit the live demo,
> press **I** for the Setup Guide, and drop your own JSON.  
>   
> Shout-out to the inspirations that sparked this direction:
> [soarxiv.org](https://soarxiv.org/), [Jarvis-CV](https://github.com/Suryansh777777/Jarvis-CV),
> and [@Sarthak](https://x.com/Sarthakhuh) for the “Neural Visualizer”
> concept.  
>   
> Repo & demo: https://github.com/ktwu01/neural-galaxy  
>  
> Would love feedback—especially from folks exploring spatial interfaces for
> personal knowledge management. 🌌

## Twitter / X Thread

1. **Tweet 1**  
   “Just shipped *Neural Galaxy* 🚀 – a browser-only 3D map of your AI chats.  
   Swipe through clusters, toggle gesture control, or press `S` for a
   screenshot. Demo + repo ↓”

2. **Tweet 2**  
   “✨ Highlights:  
   • client-side imports (privacy-first)  
   • setup wizard for ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini exports  
   • gesture HUD + minimap + floating actions”

3. **Tweet 3**  
   “Live demo (488 sample prompts) on GitHub Pages:
   https://ktwu01.github.io/neural-galaxy  
   Clone + `npm run dev` when you want to plug in your own data.”

4. **Tweet 4**  
   “Inspired by @Suryansh777777’s Jarvis CV, @SarthakHuh’s Neural Visualizer,
   and the OG soarxiv vibes. Feedback welcome! 🌠”

## YouTube Description (for a short demo clip)

> Neural Galaxy turns months of AI conversations into a gesture-controlled
> galaxy. Import your chat exports directly inside the browser (no backend,
> no data leaves your laptop) and explore clusters with a GTA-style minimap.
>  
> 🔹 Live demo & repo: https://github.com/ktwu01/neural-galaxy  
> 🔹 Setup Guide shortcut: press `I` in the app  
> 🔹 Screenshot shortcut: press `S` (3-second countdown)
>  
> Credits: soarxiv, Jarvis-CV, and the Neural Visualizer concept by
> @SarthakHuh for the inspiration.

## Demo Video Recording Script

**Setup:** Screen recorder at 60 FPS, hide dock/taskbar, keep microphone on
for narration. Use the hosted GitHub Pages demo (sample data) for speed.

1. **Intro (10s)**  
   “Hey everyone, I’m Koutian. This is Neural Galaxy—a browser-first way to
   explore your AI chat history like a sci-fi control room.”

2. **Launch + Overview (15s)**  
   Show the homepage loading. “The live demo ships with 488 synthetic
   prompts so you can fly around instantly.”

3. **Gesture Toggle (15s)**  
   Toggle gesture mode and show the HUD/minimap. Mention privacy: “Imports
   never leave the browser; even this demo runs entirely on static hosting.”

4. **Setup Guide (15s)**  
   Press `I` to open the wizard. “When you’re ready to use real ChatGPT or
   Claude exports, the Setup Guide walks you through the format and handles
   validation locally.”

5. **Screenshot Feature (10s)**  
   Press `S` to trigger the countdown + screenshot. Describe sharing the PNG.

6. **Call to Action (10s)**  
   “The repo is on GitHub—clone it, import your data, and send me your
   galaxy screenshots. Links in the description.”

Total runtime: ~75 seconds.
